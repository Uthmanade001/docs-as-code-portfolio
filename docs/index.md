This site documents real hands-on work:
- **Kubernetes (EKS)** with Terraform & Helm
- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions (build, test, deploy)
- **AWS** (ECR, EC2 via SSM, CloudWatch)
- **Containers** (Docker, Compose)
- **Runbooks** for on-call

> Built with **Docs as Code**: Markdown + Git + GitHub Actions → auto-deployed to GitHub Pages.
